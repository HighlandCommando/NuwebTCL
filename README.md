`Nuweb`, originally by Preston Briggs and now on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuweb/), is a
*literate programming* processor that produces output code files and
TeX documentation files from a single source file, called a *web*
file. This process combines the original *tangle* and *weave*
functions in `WEB` and other literate programming tools.

In its original form, `Nuweb` is a command line utility; the user
interacts with the program by typing the command name, various command
options, and the name of the target file.  This `TCL/Tk` script provides
a minimal GUI, easing the selection of the target web file, the choice of
options, and the repetitive running of `Nuweb`.
