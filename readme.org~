~Nuweb~, originally by Preston Briggs and now on [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuweb/][SourceForge]], is a
/literate programming/ processor that produces output code files and
TeX documentation files from a single source file, called a /web/
file. This process combines the original /tangle/ and /weave/
functions in ~WEB~ and other literate programming tools.

In its original form, \app{Nuweb} is a command line utility; the user
interacts with the program by typing the command name, various command
options, and the name of the target file.  This TCL/Tk script provides
a \ac{GUI} easing the selection of the target web file, the choice of
options, and the repetitive running of \app{Nuweb}.
